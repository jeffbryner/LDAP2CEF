Hi Thanks for checking out my ldap log parser.  If you are looking at this 
you realize that openldap logs are a pain to parse to gain any useful information.

Well I hope you can get some use out of this script.  Big thanks to biocode for the
assistance.  biocode++

What does it do?
This script converts multiple lines of openldap logs into the cef format.

Usage:
ldap2cef.py -i <filename>

Parameters you may need, see globals:
* out_dir - is the directory where you want the cef files to be placed
* domain - this parameter sets what domain to look for when scanning for login/logout
* secsbefore - since I am scanning the log files every 5 minutes I set this to look back
that time frame.
 

ArcSight Connector Stuff:
You can use a syslog connector or a flex connector.  I use a batch mode with a 
"Regex Multiple Folder Follower".  There you will find a CEF file option.  

Still to fix:
I still have to fix the server name who is reporting the login.
